 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and

 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.

 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings are choosen at linkage. The
 * application will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is
 * always supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. The C locale is then preset and cannot be changed.

/*!*********************************************************************************************************************
@brief Priority registers allocate all interrupts to the available
priority levels.

Interrupt Priorities (Highest -> Lowest)

Interrupt priorities start at 0 (highest priority) and go to
15 (lowest priority).  However, these correspond to Exception priorities 16 
through 31 since there are Core exceptions that are always of higher priority.
The interrupt number is processor specific and can be found around line 6650 in 
the AT91SAM3U4 header file and as "Peripheral Identifiers" on page 42 of the 10-Feb-12 datasheet.
Interrupt number / peripheral identifier has nothing to do with the corresponding interrupt priority.
Interrupt priorities are set by loading a priority slot with an interrupt number.

All unused interrupt sources will be set to priority 31.

/* To achieve the full range of audio we want from 100Hz to 20kHz, we must be able to set periods
of 10ms to 50us.
- 10ms at 48MHz clock is 480,000 ticks
- 50us at 48MHz clock is 2400 ticks
- Only 16 bits are available to set the PWM period, so scale the clock by 8:
- 10ms at 6MHz clock is 60,000 ticks
- 50us at 6MHz clock is 300 ticks

Set the default period for audio on channel 0 as 1/1kHz
1ms at 6MHz = 6000 (duty = 3000)
Set the default period for audio on channel 1 as 1/4kHz
0.25ms at 6MHz = 1500 (duty = 750)

In general, the period is 6000000 / frequency and duty is always period / 2.

Operational Notes:
RS and R/W lines are controlled to enable various states:

RS			R/W				Operation
0				 0				Instruction Write
0				 1				Read busy flag (DB7) and address counter (DB0 - DB6)
1				 0				Data Write
1				 1				Data Read

However, the I�C implementation of the LCD does not support reading data
back from the module.  Therefore, the R/W bit is always 0 which leaves
only RS to selection Instruction (Command) or Data mode.

For a two-line display, the character addresses are 0x00 - 0x27 (line 1)
and 0x40 - 0x67 (line 2), but only 20 chars can be displayed.  The extra
space can be used for scrolling displays.

ANT_TICK communicates the message period to the application.  

If ANT is running as a Master, ANT_TICK occurs every time a broadcast or acknowledged
data message is sent (EVENT_TX). 

If ANT is running as a Slave, ANT_TICK occurs whenever ANT misses a message that it was expecting 
based on the established timing of a paired channel (EVENT_RX_FAIL).  If too many missed messages
occur, then EVENT_RX_FAIL_GO_TO_SEARCH will be sent.  If a search timeout is active, 
EVENT_RX_SEARCH_TIMEOUT will be sent if the timeout period expires.

This structure is set up to also relay other channel response messages, but is currently not used.

Peripheral interrupt sources should be enabled outside of this function.

the system, we can conclude that clearing all the pending flags should
work since no peripheral interrupt sources should be connected yet.

- Interrupt priorities are set 
- All NVIC interrupts are disabled and all pending flags are cleared
